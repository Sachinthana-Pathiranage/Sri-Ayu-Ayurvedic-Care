# Sri-Ayu-Ayurvedic-Care
Sri Ayu is an AI-driven Ayurvedic wellness system designed to predict doshas, diseases, recommend treatments, predict treatment outcomes, and analyze tourism trends in Ayurveda. The platform blends machine learning models with traditional Ayurvedic principles to deliver semi-personalized healthcare recommendations.
